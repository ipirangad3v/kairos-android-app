## Architecture & Tech Stack
This application is built following modern Android development principles and a clear MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It's designed for multi-module and multi-platform (Android Phone and Wear OS) scalability.

## UI Layer:

- **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)**: The entire UI is built with Jetpack Compose for a declarative, modern, and reactive user interface, providing a native experience on both phone and watch.

- **ViewModel**: Manages UI state and business logic, exposing a single `UiState` object to the screen.

- **ComplicationDataSourceService**: Handles the logic for providing real-time calendar event data to watch face complications.

- **TileService**: Provides the data and layout for Wear OS Tiles, displaying key information at a glance.

## Data Layer:

- **Repository Pattern**: Centralizes data operations, abstracting the `ContentResolver` for fetching calendar events.

## Domain/Service Layer:

- **[WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/guide/background/persistent/getting-started)**: Handles reliable, battery-efficient background tasks for periodic alarm scheduling.

- **[AlarmManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager)**: Used to set the precise, full-screen alarms.

- **BroadcastReceivers & Services**: Manages alarm triggers, sound playback, and notification actions.

**Language**: 100% Kotlin.

## Dependency:

- **[Accompanist](https://google.github.io/accompanist/)**: For streamlined permission handling in Compose.

- **[Kizitonwose Calendar](https://github.com/kizitonwose/Calendar)**: For the highly customizable calendar view (primarily for phone UI).

- Distribution: Fastlane (Android Supply)

## Getting Started

1) Clone the repository

- git clone https://github.com/ipirangad3v/kairos-android-app.git
- cd kairos-android-app

2) Open in Android Studio

- Use the provided Gradle wrapper; Android Studio will sync automatically.

3) Configure local.properties (optional for release)

- Some release values can be injected from local.properties (see env vars below). For normal debug development, defaults and test ad units are used.

4) Run the app(s)

- Phone (app module):
  - From Android Studio: select app run configuration and Run.
  - CLI: ./gradlew :app:installDebug and then launch on device/emulator.
- Wear (wear module):
  - From Android Studio: select wear run configuration and Run (with a Wear emulator/device).
  - CLI: ./gradlew :wear:installDebug


## Tests

- Run unit tests (all modules): ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
- Run unit tests (per module):
  - Phone: ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
  - Core: ./gradlew :core:testDebugUnitTest
  - Wear: ./gradlew :wear:testDebugUnitTest
- Coverage (merged Jacoco for all modules): ./gradlew createJacocoMergedCoverageReport
  - Reports output (HTML): build/reports/jacoco/createJacocoMergedCoverageReport/html/index.html

## Environment Variables and Configuration

Debug builds:
- Use test AdMob IDs automatically; no special setup required.

Release builds may use the following environment variables (or fallback to local.properties where supported):
- ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD — Keystore password (app and wear)
- ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS — Key alias
- ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS_PASSWORD — Key password
- ADMOB_APP_ID — AdMob App ID (app, only used during release tasks)
- ADMOB_BANNER_AD_UNIT_HOME — Ad unit id for home banner (app, only used during release tasks)

Fastlane (distribution):
- REPO_ROOT — Absolute path to the repo root (used by Fastlane to locate artifacts)
- PLAY_STORE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_PLAINTEXT — The JSON key content (string) for your Google Play service account; Fastlane assigns it to GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY

Optional local.properties keys (release convenience):
- admob.app.id=<your-admob-app-id>
- admob.banner.ad.unit.home=<your-banner-ad-unit>

Signing files expected for release:
- app/release-key.jks — Phone app keystore
- wear/release-key.jks — Wear app keystore

Google services configuration (Firebase / google-services.json):

If Firebase Analytics or Crashlytics are enabled, the app expects a valid google-services.json. Without it, the app can crash at startup. Provide this file for BOTH modules: app/ and wear/.

How to generate google-services.json (Android):
- 1) Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/ and click Add project (or select an existing one).
- 2) In Project settings > Your apps, click Add app and choose Android.
- 3) Enter the Android package name: digital.tonima.kairos (same package is used for phone and wear here).
- 4) App nickname: optional (e.g., Kairos Phone or Kairos Wear).
- 5) SHA-1/SHA-256: optional but recommended if you will use features like Crashlytics, Dynamic Links, or Google Sign-In. You can obtain SHA-1 with: keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
- 6) Click Register app, then Download google-services.json.
- 7) Place a copy of the downloaded file at:
  - app/google-services.json
  - wear/google-services.json
- 8) Sync Gradle and rebuild the project (Android Studio will pick up the files automatically).

Notes:
- Do NOT commit google-services.json to public repos. Treat it as a secret.
- You can keep separate Firebase projects for debug and release as needed. Make sure the package name matches and that you add the proper SHA certificates for release builds.
- If you see a crash at startup related to Firebase initialization, verify that each module (app and wear) has its own google-services.json and that the Gradle sync completed successfully.
